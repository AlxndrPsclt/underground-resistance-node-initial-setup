# Digital freedom installer

Ansible playbook to automatically setup a personal cluster (developped and tested on RPIs)

# Instructions

To access vault-encrypted files during playbook run, you should create a `vault-password-file` at the root of the ansible folder, containing the vault password. It's already present in the .gitignore to avoid commiting it to version control.

To install:

```
$ ./launch-setup.sh
```

# Config

Comming soon
